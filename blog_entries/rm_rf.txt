<p>Reading <A HREF="http://www.veen.com/jeff/archives/000899.html">this</A>
article reminded me of my worst &quot;rm&quot; story.</p>

<P>During my senior year of college, I had an independent research
course where I was trying to devise a method of approximating the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Semantic_Indexing">LSI</a> values
of some documents. This meant that, at times, I had to generate the actual LSI
of fairly large bodies of text, which is a very slow process. I had written
some nifty python code, which did most of its work in numarray, but it still
took a whole weekend to generate one particular data set.</p>
<p>Anyway, after I had generated the data set, I started to play around with it,
writing some basic python scripts to deal with it. One of these scripts, for
some unknown reason, created a bunch of files with a &quot;?&quot; character
in the file name. So, naturally, to delete those files, I typed:</p>
<p><code>rm -rf *?*</code></p>
<p>The moment I hit the enter key, I screamed, but it was too late - I had
wiped my entire data set, including the code to create it. It took about two
weeks to get it back. And thus, I learned the importance of backups.</p>
