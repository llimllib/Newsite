No Development Today

I've been playing with my new 
<a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/iRiver_H120_20GB/4505-6490_7-30571493.html">mp3
player</a> too long, so no development news today. The player, an iRiver 
ihp-120, is excellent so far. I wanted it over an iPod because it simply acts
as an external hard drive, with no acrobatics. It works on every platform; 
although I haven't tried it on my Linux partition yet, I've read that
usb_hotplug detects it just like any other portable hd.<p>
The only other thing I've been doing is uploading my music profile to a
recommendations/community music site, and I'm very impressed with it. The site
is called <a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.com">Audioscrobbler</a>, and it's
related closely to <a href="http://last.fm">last.fm</a>. To use them both (at
the same time) just download a winamp (or iTunes or xmms or...) plugin to
your computer and play music like normal. In the background, it uploads to
their servers what songs you've been playing, and builds your profile from
that information.<p>
You can see what I've been listening to at
<a href="http://www.last.fm/user/llimllib">my profile</a> page at last.fm, and
even listen to a radio station consisting of random songs from my playlist.
