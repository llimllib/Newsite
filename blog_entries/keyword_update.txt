Keywords Plugin Update

Inspired by Justus' comments on my
<a href="http://billmill.org/templating.html">templating</a>
article, I made a couple of updates to my keywords plugin which I had been
meaning to make for a while.<p>

First off, you'll see that the keyword 
list on the left only contains the top 20 most common keywords, sorted by 
frequency. Second, 
<a href="http://billmill.org/Keywords/python+job">http://billmill.org/Keywords/python+job</a>
should now bring up all entries with both the python and the job keyword on
them.<p>
The updated plugin is available 
<a href="http://billmill.org/static/files/meta_plugins.tar.gz">here</a>.
