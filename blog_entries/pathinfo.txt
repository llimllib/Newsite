Pyblosxom Hacking Continued

Tonight, I reimplemented the default path handler in a plugin. My goal was
to gain a deep understanding of it, because I have an idea that may prove to
help dynamic pyblosxom rendering quite a bit. At the same time, I think I made
it quite a bit clearer (it was a big mess before - sorry to whoever wrote it).
I tested its performance, and found it to be, on average, about .002 seconds 
slower than the default.<p>
To time it, I used this simple script:
<p><h2>timeurl.py</h2><br>
<textarea rows="10" cols="50">
#!/usr/bin/env wpython
import urllib
import timeit

PAGE = "http://localhost/blox_devel/pyblosxom/pyblosxom.cgi"
url = urllib.URLopener()
t = timeit.Timer('url.open(PAGE).read()', \
    'from __main__ import url, PAGE')
print t.timeit(100)   #repeat 100 times

The idea which I believe may help dynamic rendering performance is
entry_list caching. Using Robert Wall's
<a href="http://robwall.com/article/32/pyblosxom-performance-analysis">profiling</a>
script, I found that 22% of a request for the main page was spent generating
the file list. On his results, if I read them correctly, that number was nearly
50%. If I was to pickle the file_list of a common query, it would add time
to the first user's access, but could remove a significant load for subsequent
user accesses. If I do it right, I may even be able to delay the caching
until after the page is rendered.<p>
During testing of the new pathinfo plugin, I discovered errors in my metatime
module, so I'm going to work on fixing those. Hopefully I'll fix that tonight,
and then tomorrow I'll have my choice of working on caching or static rendering.
