I'm sure other people have done this, but for the past couple of weeks I've
been playing the <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> game all by 
myself.<p>
"But Bill," I can hear you thinking, "What is this del.icio.us game that you
speak of?".<p>
Well, I'm glad you asked. It's very simple. To play, you simply go about your 
daily business
(or more likely procrastination) on the interweb, bookmarking interesting pages
to del.icio.us as I'm sure you already do. Every so often, you check
your user page (at http://del.icio.us/your_user_name) and look at your links.
You win points by checking out who else has copied your bookmarked pages - look
for the little link that says "and x other people".<p>
There is a sliding point scale, which I am making up arbitrarily right now,
since I
don't need to keep score with myself. Use this as a guide, but feel free to
give yourself points for whatever you feel is pointsworthy. It's a little like
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Nook/2990/cb_rules.htm">Calvinball</a>. Anyway, here's my scale:<br /><ul>
<li><em>15 points</em>: You were the
first one to link a page which has been linked to more than 50 times.
<li><em>10 points</em>: You were the first one to link a page which has been
linked to more than 25 times, but 50 or less times.
<li><em>6 points</em>: You were the first to post a link after a 24-hour "dead
link period" where nobody else did it, and 4 or more people followed your lead
in a day.
<li><em>4 points</em>: You have, by far, the wittiest comment on a link with
more than 4 other people in its list.
<li><em>2 points</em>: Your hair really looks nice today.
<li><em>-12 points</em>: You are the last person to post that stupid but
popular link that
everybody thought was funny yesterday, but is totally passe today.
</ul><p>
Everybody count up your scores, link to this post, and show off your high score
to your friends!
