There are a lot of descriptions out there of how to do this, and most of them
are outdated or just plain wrong. Here's what worked for me, yesterday. It
assumes you've got Cygwin + gcc and the windows version of python 2.4, all
installed into the default locations:<p>

<ol>
<li>Get <a href="http://sebsauvage.net/python/pexports-0.42h.zip">pexport</a>
and extract it into a directory
<li>copy c:/Winnt/system32/python24.dll to the pexport directory
<li>run pexports python24.dll > python24.def
<li>run dlltool --dllname python24.dll --def python24.def --output-lib
libpython24.a
<li>copy libpython24.a to c:\python24\libs\
<li>run c:\python24\python.exe setup.py build --compiler=mingw32
</ol>
This worked well enough for me to build <a
href="http://probstat.sourceforge.net">probstat</a> successfully - I haven't
tried it with anything else. I hope it helps, but if it doesn't work... as
always, ask <a
href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.python">c.l.p.</a><p>
