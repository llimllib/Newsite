<p>And hopefully, there'll be some things to write about on billmill.org soon.
I've written a port of <a href="http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/">pyblosxom</a>
to the <a href="http://cherrypy.org">cherrypy</a> platform, which I'll release
as soon as I figure out how to release it with all the setuptools goodness it
deserves.<p>

For now, you'll have to content yourself with a bunch of broken links and some
<a href="http://billmill.org/static/galleries/">pictures</a>. There's more to
come, and soon.
