I've continued hacking around in pyblosxom, and I've implemented another 
plugin. I also generalized my meta plugin and documented both the meta plugin
and the keyword plugin. You can get the whole updated package (still beta, but
runninig this site) 
<a href="http://billmill.org/static/files/meta_plugins.tar.gz">here</a>.<p>
With the time plugin, to alter the time of a blog entry, you simply include
a comment in the body of the blog entry of the form:<br>
<code class="inline">&lt;!--time: mm/dd/yy HH:MM--&gt;</code><br>You can see an example of
this if you do a view source on this entry.<p>
My next plan is to set up static rendering, and then hopefully set it up so
that it uploads all new blog entries to my ftp server. If that works, then I'll
actually have a blog that I feel comfortable with.
