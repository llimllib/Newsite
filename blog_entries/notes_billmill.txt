Introducing notes.billmill.org
#time 05-06-22 16:00
<p>For the past few months, I've been keeping notes in <a
href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>, and I decided that I wanted to share
them; mostly for my own reference, but also in case they're useful to anybody
else.

<p>Thus <a href="https://notes.billmill.org">notes.billmill.org</a> was born.

<p>A feature I really enjoy about Obsidian is that it stores documents as folders of markdown files, so that should I ever decide to leave the app, all my notes can follow me to whatever I use next.

<p>That feature also makes it easy to do what I've done with <a href="https://notes.billmill.org">notes.billmill.org</a> - write a simple program that goes through all my notes files and publishes them as HTML.

<p>You can find the <a href="https://github.com/llimllib/obsidian_notes/">code
for publishing the site</a> on github, but I don't think it is likely to be too
valuable to anybody but myself. The site is published on a highly technical
schedule of "whenever I decide to run <span class="highlight inline">make publish</span>".
