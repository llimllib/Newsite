<p>I created <a href="http://billmill.org/static/canvastutorial">a tutorial</a> 
on the use of the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_(HTML_element)">&lt;canvas&gt;
element</a> in HTML.
<p>The tutorial takes you step by step through the creation of a clone of the 
classic video game <a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(arcade_game)">Breakout</a>. At 
each step, you can edit the code of the game written so far, and immediately 
run it to see what the output is.

<p>The code is taken from the <a 
href="http://billmill.org/static/refresh-canvas/presentation/index-osf.html">presentation</a> 
I gave in August to <a href="http://refreshbmore.org/">Refresh Baltimore</a>, 
and the source code can all be found at my <a 
href="http://github.com/llimllib/refresh-canvas/tree/master/tutorial">github 
repository</a>.
