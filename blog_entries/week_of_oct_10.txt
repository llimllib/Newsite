<ul class="spaciouslist">
  <li>The <a href="https://github.com/swar/nba_api">NBA API</a> wrapper by Swar Patel, Randy Forbes et al, is a really nice wrapper around the nba.com API that seems to be semi-officially tolerated by the NBA</li>
  <li>I love the <a href="https://github.com/tigerbeetledb/tigerbeetle/blob/main/docs/TIGER_STYLE.md">TIGER_STYLE</a> document from the tigerbeetle database, which lays out their style and the axioms they've chosen to abide by. More projects ought to lay out their stances as clearly as this, and I've tried to start doing so in my own projects.</li>
  <li><a href="https://superset.apache.org/">Apache Superset</a> is an interesting-looking tool that I found from <a href="https://duckdb.org/2022/10/12/modern-data-stack-in-a-box.html">this duckDB blog article</a>. I tried to play around with it though, and it seemed pretty painful to actually get data into.</li>
  <li>I like <a href="https://driftingin.space/posts/plane">this idea</a> of per-document backends; it introduces a lot of complexities but also eases some of the problems of stateless web development for particular workloads. I have been thinking about workloads like this in combination with a site that uses many SQLite databases instead of one large relational data store.</li>
  <li><a href="https://remake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#">remake</a> looks neat, a GNU Make-alike which "adds profiling, comprehensible tracing, extended error messages and a debugger". I love make, and this seems like a useful complementary tool</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.scratchapixel.com/">Scratchapixel</a> looks like an interesting series of computer graphics tutorials, which is a thing I love to collect but ultimately rarely have the time to mess around with. Aspirations though.</li>
  <li>This week I learned about the <span class="highlight inline">reveal_type</span> <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/blob/main/docs/type-concepts.md#debugging-inferred-types">function of pyright</a>, which made my debugging <a href="https://notes.billmill.org/programming/python/pyright.html">life easier</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-15-released-2526/">postgresql 15 was released</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://obsidian.md/1.0">obsidian 1.0 was released</a>. Obsidian has been the first note-taking tool I've ever found simple and compelling enough to stick with, and I'm very happy with it.</li>
  <li>Enjoyed this <a href="https://twitter.com/CommonFateTech/status/1580449400580472832">Database alignment chart</a></li>
  <li>Greg Linares tells the story of <a href="https://twitter.com/Laughing_Mantis/status/1579550302172508161">exploits delivered on drones</a></li>
  <li>Warren Craddock tweeted a fascinating <a href="https://twitter.com/warren_craddock/status/1579532951624175616">tale of companies too obsessed with themselves to notice their own failures.</a> How do you dream big, but also stop when it's clear you have a fatal flaw?</li>
  <li>Russ Cox <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/discussions/56010">considers a big backwards-incompatible change</a> to go, to eliminate the <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/20733">loop variable capture</a> problem.
  <li>I <a href="https://llimllib.github.io/nbastats/teams/">created a diamond chart</a> of NBA team efficiencies and wrote <a href="https://twitter.com/llimllib/status/1580379876112052225">a little twitter thread about it</a>. Hopefully more on this soon.</li>
  <li>I got a new work computer, so I created <a href="https://gist.github.com/llimllib/5f01219954e213ec57ae267008e702e5">a new version of my mac OS X installation script</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Music</h2>

<ul class="spaciouslist">
  <li>Nobody's Fault But Mine is an American classic. I used to listen to the blues a lot, and I might have to go back and revisit some of my favorites.

  <li>There's more, new, King Gizzard this week. Just an unbelievably productive band. <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2202315/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-stu-mackenzie/interviews/cover-story/">This article</a> dives into their process a bit.

  <li>I posted about Hania Rani last week, and I dove in some more this week. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5oZ80Daduc">This hour long set is great</a>, as is this KEXP set:
