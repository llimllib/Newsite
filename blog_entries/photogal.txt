Photo Gallery, meta update, and I have no cache

I updated the meta plugins to lock meta files before writing to and reading from
them, so I also updated the corresponding <a 
href="http://billmill.org/static/files/meta_plugins.tar.gz">archive</a>. Also, I
think the cache mechanism is finished until pyblosxom 1.1 is released (should
be soon). At that point, I'll check the whole thing in and wait patiently for
people to bawl me out because it broke things.<p>
More bad pun titles to come as soon as I can resume on the cache. In the 
meantime, here's what I saw when I logged in to check my finances this 
afternoon:<p>
In case you were wondering, I got the <a
href="http://billmill.org/Keyword/job">job</a> I
was interviewing for, but paychecks are about a month away. I'll be scraping
until then.<p>
<h2>Photo Gallery</h2><p>
I am currently checking out the photo galleries that exist for pyblosxom. I
like the idea given by <a 
href="http://dealmeida.net/en/Programming/Pyblosxom/a_photo_gallery_for_pyblosxom">Roberto
de Almeida</a>, who uses RDF embedded in JPEG comment fields to store image
metadata. I would like it to be able to display galleries in a much more
complete way than it seems to allow, as well as allow comments to files, so 
I'll be looking at extending it. That would give me a chance to learn some
XML and tinker with the JPEG file format, so I think I'll give it a spin.<p>
It seems that the only other photo gallery software is <a 
href="http://www.planetpyblosxom.org/blog/registry/display/graphics/photogallery">this</a>
plugin; I'll give it a try. Since I've been thinking about this for a while,
though, I'm willing to bet that I'll try my hand at writing my own.<p>
UPDATE: I'm going to check out <a
href="http://fotonotes.net/spec/index.cgi?FotoNotes">FotoNotes</a> for image
metadata as well.
